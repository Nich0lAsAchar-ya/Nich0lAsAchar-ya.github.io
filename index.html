  <!--Who am I -->
    <h1 style = "text-align: center;">Who am I?</h1>
    <p>My name is Nicholas, and Iâ€™m a student at VPCI. When Iâ€™m not at school, youâ€™ll usually find me on the soccer field, playing piano or doing homework.  Soccerâ€™s been a huge part of my life, and I love staying active, while piano is my way of relaxing and playing something that I enjoy listening to. Like most people, I also love watching TV. My favourite show is Attack On Titan's which I really recommend to watch. You can explore my website to learn more about me!</p>

            Unfortunately I donâ€™t have any pets ðŸ˜” but when I'm older I want to have a catâ€”maybe even a couple! I visit my uncle every year and he has a cat, which makes me jealous every visit.
